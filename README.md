# untitledTitle
I have made this site from scratch as a fun project. The main focus was the layout and some animations.

I have really enjoyed diving into animations and transitions using pure CSS. One of the challanges was the fixed nav bar and it's functionality, also the dropdown menu was a new thing as well. I was mostly familiar with the :hover psuedo-class but have tried to make the most out of it in this project.
